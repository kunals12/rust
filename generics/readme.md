## Generics in Rust

### Introduction

Generics allow you to write flexible and reusable code. They enable you to write functions, structs, enums, and methods that can operate on many different data types while ensuring type safety.

### Why Use Generics?
Generics are useful when you want to write code that can handle different types in a type-safe way. For example, if you have a function that works on integers, you might also want it to work on floats or other types without duplicating the code.

### Simple Explanation

Think of generics like placeholders. When you define a generic type, you're saying, "I don't care what type this is, as long as it's consistent."
