# Understanding `Result` in Rust

## Introduction

In Rust, the `Result` type is used for functions that can return either a success value or an error. This is essential for error handling in Rust and helps ensure that errors are handled properly.

## The `Result` Type

The `Result` type is an enum that looks like this:

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

`Ok(T)` represents a success value of type T.

`Err(E)` represents an error value of type E.
