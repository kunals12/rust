# Understanding `Option` in Rust

## Introduction

In Rust, the `Option` type is used to represent a value that can be either something or nothing. This is useful for cases where a value might be missing or not applicable.

## The `Option` Type

The `Option` type is an enum that looks like this:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

`Some(T)` represents a value of type T.

`None` represents the absence of a value.
